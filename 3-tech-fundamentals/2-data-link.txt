Layer 2 - Data link
-------------------
Frames are used to send data over an L2 network

L2 introduces MAC address which is used to identify a device on L2 network

Data being transferred to L1 from L2 is not understood by L1

Frame breakdown:
- Preamble: start of the frame and information about the frame
- Destination MAC address
- Source MAC address
- Ether type (which L3 protocol is putting its data in the frame)
- Payload (46-1500 bytes): data being sent - supplied by L3 protocol
- FCS (frame check sequence): used to check if corruption has occurred

How data gets sent:
- A uses L1 and intends to send data to B. L2 creates a frame
- If there's no signal being sent on L1, data will be sent. This check is done with CSMA (carrier sends multiple access)
- Block of data is sent over L1
- B receives raw data and parses it as a frame. It sees the data is destined is for itself and uses the data

L2 devices can detect collisions and send jam signals to prevent any devices from sending transmission

Switch: uses a MAC address table to learn the addresses of all the devices on the network. 
If the switch doesn't have the address beforehand, it will forward to all ports. Otherwise it will send it 
directly to the destination

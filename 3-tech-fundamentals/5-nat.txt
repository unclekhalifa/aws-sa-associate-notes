NAT (Network Address Translation)

Created to overcome IPv4 shortages
Also provides security benefits

Static NAT: 1 private IP to 1 public IP (IGW)

Dynamic NAT: 1 private to 1st available public

Port address translation (PAT): many private to 1 public (NATGW)

IPv6 means no need for NAT

Static NAT walkthrough:
- Device A wishes to send data to API via NAT device
- NAT replaces source IP of packets from private to public IP address
- Public IP in response packets are then replaced with private IP address

Dynamic NAT walkthrough:
- Similar to static except there's a pool of public IPs that can be dynamically and temporarily allocated
- If all public IPs are in use and another device tries to send a request, it will fail

PAT walkthrough (NATGW):
- Translates the source IP and port to be different to the original before forwarding packets to the destination
- Updates NAT table with the original source IPs and ports to make sure they're returning to the original sender

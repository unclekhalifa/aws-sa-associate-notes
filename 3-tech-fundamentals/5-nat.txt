NAT (Network Address Translation)

Created to overcome IPv4 shortages
Also provides security benefits

Static NAT: 1 private IP to 1 public IP (IGW)

Dynamic NAT: 1 private to 1st available public

Port address translation (PAT): many private to 1 public (NATGW)

IPv6 means no need for NAT

Static NAT walkthrough:
- Device A wishes to send data to API via NAT device
- NAT replaces source IP of packets from private to public IP address
- Public IP in response packets are then replaced with private IP address

Dynamic NAT walkthrough:
- Similar to static except there's a pool of public IPs that can be dynamically and temporarily allocated
- If all public IPs are in use and another device tries to send a request, it will fail

PAT walkthrough (NATGW):
- Translates the source IP and port to be different to the original before forwarding packets to the destination
- Updates NAT table with the original source IPs and ports to make sure they're returning to the original sender

IP Addresses

Class A IP addresses - huge networks. First octet is for the network:
- 0.0.0.0 - 127.255.255.255

Class B IP addresses - larger businesses. First 2 octets are for the network:
- 128.0.0.0 - 191.255.255.255

Class C - smaller businesses. First 3 octets are for the network:
- 192.0.0.0 - 223.255.255.255

Reserved private IP addresses:
- 10.0.0.0 - 10.255.255.255 (Class A networks)
- 172.16.0.0 - 172.31.255.255 (Class B networks)
- 192.168.0.0 - 192.168.255.255 (Class C networks)


Classless Inter Domain Routing (CIDR)
The larger the prefix, the smaller the network

Subnetting is the process of taking a larger network and breaking it down into smaller networks

Calculating subnet

Calculate start and end of the network
10.16.0.0/16 = 10.16.0.0 => 10.16.255.255

Split the original range into 2 and increment the prefix
10.16.0.0/17 = 10.16.0.0 => 10.16.127.255

10.16.128.0/17 = 10.16.128.0 => 10.16.255.255

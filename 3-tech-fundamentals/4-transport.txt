Layer 4 - Transport
-------------------

Adds 2 new protocols: 
- TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)
- UDP (User Data Protocol)

TCP is picked for reliability & error correction. Usually for HTTP
Creates a bidirectional channel

UDP is faster but less reliable

TCP transfers data using Segments and are encapsulated within IP packets

Segments breakdown (TCP header):
- Source port
- Destination port
- Sequence number: used for error correction and ordering of IP packets
- Acknowledgment: a way to show that the segment was received by the destination
- Flags 'n' things: used to close connections and other options
- TCP window: number of bytes willing to receive after acknowledgment
- Checksum: used for error checking
- Urgent pointer: used to control traffic

SSL 3 way handshake

1. Cipher suite
TLS begins with established TCP connection. 
Agree on the method of communication

Client says HELLO with SSL/TLS version, cipher suites, Session ID

SERVER says HELLO with server certificate (public key)

2. Authentication

Ensure the server certificate is authentic, verifying the 
server as legitimate

This will be done by a certificate authority (CA)

The client trusts the public CA - it makes sure that the certificate 
is valid (hasn't been revoked) and the DNS name matches the name on the cert

The client verifies the server has the private key by sending some encrypted random data

3. Key exchange

Move from asymmetric to symmetric key in a secure way and begin encryption process

The client generates the pre master key, encrypts it with the server's public key and sends it to the server

The server decrypts the pre master key using its private key

Both sides use the same pre master key to generate the master secret which is used to generate the ongoing 
session keys which encrypt and decrypt data

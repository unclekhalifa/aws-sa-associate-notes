AWS Accounts
------------

- An AWS account is a container for identities (users) and resources
- Account root user has full control over all of this AWS account and any resources created within it & cannot be restricted
- IAM users, groups and roles can also be created and given full or limited permissions
- Having multiple AWS accounts is considered best practice to limit disasters. Ex: prod, dev & test accounts
- Unless you explicitly allow something, by default access is denied

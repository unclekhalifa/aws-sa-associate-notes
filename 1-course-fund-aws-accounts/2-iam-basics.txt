IAM
---
IAM is globally resilient (always secure across all AWS regions)
Each account has 1 IAM database.

IAM user: identities which represent humans or applications that need access to the account

IAM group: collection of related users, e.g. development, finance, etc

IAM role: can be used by AWS services, for granting external access to your account

IAM policies: used to allow or deny access to services only when they're attached to users, groups or roles.
On their own, they don't do anything

IAM:
- manages identities (IDP)
- authenticates
- authorises

Best practices
--------------
Only grant access as it's required - i.e. least privilege
Only use account root user to set up the account

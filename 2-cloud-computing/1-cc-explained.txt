Cloud Computing
---------------

Characteristics of cloud computing:

1. On demand self service: can provision capabilities as needed 
without requiring human interaction

2. Broad network access: capabilities are available over the network and 
accessed through standard mechanisms

3. Resource pooling: there is a sense of location independence - no control 
or knowledge over the exact location of the resources. Resources are pooled to 
serve multiple consumers using a multi tenant model

4. Rapid elasticity: capabilities can be elasticically provisioned and released to 
scale rapidly outward and inward with demand. Capabilities often appear to be unlimited

5. Measured service: resource usage can be monitored, controlled, reported and billed

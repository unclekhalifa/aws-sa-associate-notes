VPC
---

- Virtual network inside AWS
- VPC is within 1 account & 1 region
- VPC are regionally resilient
- By default, VPC is private and isolated unless you decide otherwise

Two types of VPC:
- Default VPC: 1 per region
- Custom VPCs: many per region

Multiple VPCs can be configured within an AWS account but there is no way (by default) for these VPCs to communicate with each other

Default VPC
-----------
- 0-1 region per VPC: can be removed & recreated
- Default VPC CIDR is always 172.31.0.0/16 - limiting/inflexible
- /20 subnet in each AZ in the region
- Default IGW, Security group & NACL
- Subnets assign public IPv4 addresses

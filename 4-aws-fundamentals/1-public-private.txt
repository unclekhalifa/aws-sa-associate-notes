Public service: needs to be accessible via public internet with no restrictions. Example: S3

Private service: no direct connectivity to the public. Example: EC2. No way to connect to internet or AWS public services by default

Three zones:
- Public internet
- AWS public zone: AWS services are not on the public internet - they're in this zone
- AWS private zone: usually isolated in the VPC (virtual private cloud). Only things that can connect are resources in the same private network or on premises private cloud

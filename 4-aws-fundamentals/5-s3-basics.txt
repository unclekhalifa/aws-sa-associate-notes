S3 basics
---------

Global storage platform - regional based/resilient

Public service, unlimited data and multi user

Used for movies, audio, photos, text and large datasets

Economical and accessed via UI/CLI/API/HTTP

Delivers objects and buckets

Objects have:
- Key: think of it as a filename
- Value: sequence of binary data

An object can be 0KB or 5TB (max)

AWS bucket names are globally unique i.e. you cannot have the same name as someone else

Buckets can hold unlimited number of objects

Object storage is a flat structure i.e. everything is on the same level, not like a filesystem

Folders are called prefixes. These days they're called folders

Bucket names need to be between 3 - 63 characters, all lower cases, no underscores

Buckets have a 100 soft limit, 1000 hard limit per account

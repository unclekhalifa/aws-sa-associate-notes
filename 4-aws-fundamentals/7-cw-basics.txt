Collects and manages operational data:
- Metrics: information about AWS products, apps, on premises, etc. Example, disk usage for an EC2 instance
- CloudWatch Logs: collecting logs by things like Windows server, Apache, etc
- CloudWatch Events: provides services and schedules

Namespace: container for monitoring data
    - All AWS services go into a namespace called AWS/{{serviceName}}
    - Namespaces contain related metrics

Metrics: time ordered set of data points. Example: CPU usage, network, disk IO, etc
    A metric is not for a specific server

Datapoint: consists of a timestamp and value. Example, CPU utilisation metric would contain multiple datapoints for CPU usages

Dimension: used to differentiate multiple resources sending data to the same metric

Example: given a CPUUtilisation metric, we could have 3 servers sending multiple datapoints. We would 
also have dimensions telling us which information came from which instance

CW allows us to take actions based on metrics

An alarm is linked to a metric. Example: CPU usage being > 80% would move to an alarm state, OK state otherwise

An alarm could send notifications to an SNS topic or send emails

AWS global infrastructure
-------------------------

AWS regions: area of the world with AWS infrastructure (compute, storage, DB, etc). Example: London, Paris, Ohio, etc

AWS edge locations: local distribution points - smaller than regions. Helpful for storing data as close to customers as possible for fast data transfer

Region benefits:
- Geographic separation - isolated fault domain. Won't have any issues with natural disasters
- Geopolitical separation - different governance
- Location control - keeping resources as close to users as possible

Region code: eu-west-2
Region name: London

Availability Zone: logically isolated compute, storage, networking, power and facility within a region
AZ is not necessarily a data centre

Services can be placed across multiple AZs to make them resilient - example, VPC

Globally resilient: service operates globally with a single database. Example: IAM & R53
Region resilient: operate in single region with single dataset. Example: RDS
AZ resilient: deployed in a single AZ. If that AZ fails, that service fails

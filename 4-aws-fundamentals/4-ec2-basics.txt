Amazon Machine Image: can be used to create an EC2 instance or can be used to create an AMI

AMIs contain:
- attached permissions:
    - public: everyone can launch instances from this
    - owner: only the owners can launch
    - explicit: permissions for specific AWS accounts
- root volume: C: drive for example
- block device mapping: config which links the volumes the AMI has and how they're presented to the OS

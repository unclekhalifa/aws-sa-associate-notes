High Availability
-----------------

Aims to ensure an agreed level of operational performance, usually uptime, for a higher than normal period

Think of a load balanced infrastructure

Fault tolerance
---------------

Property that enables a system to continue operating properly in the event of the failure of some of its components

Think of a medical device that needs to be up no matter what. It would need redundancy in all layers and ensure they're always up

Minimise outage and design system to tolerate a failure

Disaster recovery
-----------------
A set of policies, tools and procedures to enable the recovery or continuation of vital technology infrastructure and systems following a natural or human disaster

DR would be a drill exercise on how to respond when there's an outage

Important to note
-----------------
Implementing FT when you only need HA takes longer, costs more and is more complex to design
Implementing HA when you need FT may potentially put lives at risk

HA minimises any outages
FT means operating through faults
DR is used when the above don't work
